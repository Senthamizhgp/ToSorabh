			Element listing all the supported item dispenser devices. Each device is identified by the unique numeric value indicated by "id" attribute.
			The device configuration with the "id" attribute must be present in the "itemdispensers" element of SPM_DeviceConfiguration.xml.
			
			There are two following types of item dispensers supported: 
			1) MDB based ID (USD Mode 2).
			2) GPIO based ID (direct control of the motors/spirals).

			Following are list of dynamic parameters which should be entered by user when MDB based ID (id="1300") activated in configuration.
			1) usd_mode : Currently only USD mode 2 is supported so this tag added for future expansion.
			
			Following are list of dynamic parameters which should be entered by user when GPIO based ID (id="1301") activated in configuration.
			1) interrupt_pin_number :	This is used for rotation based Item dispenser. A GPI pin can be specified using this element. 
										For each rotation Item dispenser will send interrupt at this pin to confirm one rotation of spiral 
										dispensing mechanism.
			2) dispense_type : 	Time or rotation based approach. 
								In time based Item dispenser user has to specify time (i.e. duration for which motor will on) under <time> tag. 
								In rotation based Item dispenser user has to specify no of rotation (i.e., motor will spin that number of rotations) 
								under <rotation> tag.
			3) threshold_voltage and threshold_current :	Threshold voltage and threshold current are Item dispenser motor’s threshold limits in volts
															and Amps respectively.User has to update these value based on the motor configuration.
			4) motor_mode :	There are two types of modes supported - Normal mode and Matrix mode. User has to select one motor mode from these two modes.
							Based on this type, user has to update <gpio_combination> tag. In normal mode user has to set only one motor pin out of 26 pins 
							based on motor setup. While in matrix mode user has to set two GPIO pin. Among them one pin from Low Side Bridge (from 11 to 26) 
							and one pin from High Side Bridge (from 1 to 10) based on motor setup.
